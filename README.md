<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./code-victor.github.io_my-team-page_.png)

A simple but interesting user interface. It shows the members of a team in the most exiciting way.
My big take aways were 
- Making the pictures have custom patterns with hard coding the values
- flipping the text over
- responsiveness
- What do you like about this?
